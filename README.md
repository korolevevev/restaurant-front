# Frontend part of a Restaurant CRM

🌐Live demo: https://korolevevev.github.io/restaurant-front

What it can do:

• Authorization page: enter 'admin' login and 'kaifprovenance' password. You can also log out clicking "Выйти".

• Menu section: you can add, delete, search, sort and edit dishes

• Orders section: you can add orders filling a waiter, total etc. 

An app works together with backend made or Java (see https://github.com/korolevevev/restaurant-back). It's connected to PostgreSQL database with two tables.
Working with dishes and orders goes by custom API - GET and POST HTTP queries.
